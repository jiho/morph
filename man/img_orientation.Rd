\title{Orientation of object on image}
\usage{
img_orientation(x, direction = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a greyscale image, of type \code{\link[imager:cimg]{imager::cimg()}}}

\item{direction}{try to resolve the 180ยบ uncertainty in orientation: orient the ellipse (and therefore the angle) towards the denser part of the object. On a binary image, the denser part is the largest. On a greyscale image, the denser part is the lightest (because black=0, white=1).}
}
\value{
The orientation angle.
}
\description{
Compute the orientation angle of the best fitting ellipse based on image moments.
}
\details{
Image moments only make sense for light on dark images. If your image is dark on light, invert it before computing the orientation with this function.

On an image displayed with \code{\link[=img_show]{img_show()}}, the angle is given from the horizontal, in clockwise direction, in degrees. The computation gives it in trigonometric convention (from the horizontal, towards the positive side of the y axis, in radians) but (i) in an image, the y axis increases when going \emph{down}, (ii) the angle is converted in degrees for easiness.

\examples{
# read an image of an asymetric shape
x <- img_read(system.file("extdata", "shape.png", package="morphr"))
x <- imager::imrotate(x, 45)
img_show(x)
img_orientation(x)
# 45ยบ from horizontal, clockwise
img_orientation(x, direction=TRUE)
# the highest density is in the same direction
# rotate it to make the object horizontal, with highest density on the right
imager::imrotate(x, -45) \%>\% img_show()

# now if we work with the mask of the object
img_show(x>0)
img_orientation(x>0)
img_orientation(x>0, direction=TRUE)
# the highest density is now at the opposite end
# so the angles are opposed by 180ยบ
# and to make the object horizontal and with highest density on the right
imager::imrotate(x>0, -225) \%>\% img_show()

# try with a real image
# (NB: inverted to allow the computation of moments)
x <- img_read(system.file("extdata", "amphipoda/33463695.jpg",
